  Hi ppl, I am Erick. A curious person with ambition and potential ideas (I know I have them in here somewhere, they're currently stuck in my brain). At the moment, I'm working on OOP with Java and also Python development but thinking of going into the field of front-end web development. 
  

Always open to learning new things.


I like me a good read.
